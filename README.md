# 📊 Bike Sales Excel Dashboard

### 🎯 Project Type  
**Data Cleaning • Dashboard Design • Excel-Based Insight Delivery**

---

### 📌 Project Overview  
This project turns raw, disorganized bike sales data into a fully interactive Excel dashboard that simulates how real businesses can track performance across regions, product categories, and customer segments.

But more importantly — it demonstrates how a well-structured dashboard can **change the way a business thinks**, even in the absence of complex tools. With clean logic, interactive filters, and visual storytelling, this Excel solution could live on someone’s desktop and still drive smarter decisions without ever touching code.

If this dashboard didn’t exist, a stakeholder would still be guessing. With it, they’re suddenly empowered to ask better questions — and answer them instantly.
